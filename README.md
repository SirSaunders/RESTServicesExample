# RESTServicesExample
Example of REST web service interactions for AOOD

to start the sever:
install AWS Chalice with `pip install chalice`
then `cd webserver` finally do `chalice local` 
this will start the server locally on your machine

to start the client simply open the `index.html` file found in the 
`webapp` folder in your browser (we tested in Google Chrome)
